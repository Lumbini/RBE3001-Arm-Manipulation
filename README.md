### Abstract: 
A Control system design used on an automated 2-Degree of Freedom (DOF) arm to pickup blocks moving on a conveyor. The design relies on a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller along with forward and inverse kinematics to move the end effector to the required position. Block sensing is done by using two infrared sensors and the weight is determined using current sensing.
